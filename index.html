              <p>Sitting facing her, are a dozen Indian children
                attempting to meditate. One lies on his back looking up
                at his hands, pretending they are a bird, flying over
                head. Isabel stands and walks to him.
                She kneels next to him and looks at his bird-hands. After
                a moment, she lies next to him. She whispers in.
                What kind of bird is that?
                The 7 year old boy, JAI, looks at her and shrugs his
                shoulders. Isabel puts her hands up in the air and makes
                a bird of her own. They fly together
                </p>

              <h1>User Reviews</h1>
              <p>4 EXT. CALCUTTA STREET, IMPOVERISHED AREA - LATER THAT DAY 4
                Isabel, Jai, and a few other children from the orphanage,
                ride in the back of an open pick up truck down a dusty
                street.
                A group of hungry local children chase the truck as it
                pulls up in an open square and stops.
                The driver gets out and the local kids surround the
                truck. Isabel and the orphans begin their routine of
                serving a meal from giant pots; rice and lentils. The
                hungry children wait with cups and get food ladled in.
                5 INT. BACK OF TRUCK - LATE AFTERNOON 5
                The exhausted group rides back toward the orphanage. The
                sun has just set and the sky is a silvery blue. Jai is
                glued to Isabel’s side as they all sing a song.
                6 INT./ EXT. ORPHANAGE - EVENING 6
                Isabel’s truck pull in.
                A French aid worker, JAQUES (Late 40’s), is laying out
                some supplies he has brought in a van. Isabel’s truck
                pulls in and she hops out, anxiously.

                  Where are the beds? The food? And there
                  were supposed to be school supplies.
                  JAQUES
                  We can hang hammocks. Temporarily.
                  A beat as they look at each other.
                  JAQUES (CONT'D)
                  It’s all I could get. For the money.
                  She looks at him slightly confused, then shakes her head
                  and marches away.
                  7 INT. ORPHANAGE OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 7
                  Isabel marches in.
                  ISABEL
                  Where’s the money we were promised? How
                  long are we supposed to wait?
                  The director of the orphanage, PREENA (60’s), sits at her
                  desk, going over some paperwork. She removes her glasses
                  and takes a deep breath.
